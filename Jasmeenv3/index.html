    <p id="caption">Silent but present. I think that explains our relationship very well. From the day I invited you into my dorm to today, you’ve been a strong and steady person that I know I can rely on if I ever face any difficulty. I hope you feel the same about me. I’ll always be there if you ever need me. Although we do not talk a lot, your presence in my life gives me a lot of joy. Our shared music, culture, and life experiences gives me a lot of comfort in a place where I don’t see many people like myself. Keep being yourself and let no one change you. Love, Gursheen</p>

      <p>To our dearest Jasmeen,

        You have a calm and comforting personality, and that follows you wherever you go. Your stories and our talks are always so inspiring. You are an amazing singer, never failing to amaze us with your melodious songs. We love how you spontaneously burst into songs and still make it sound effortless. In a way, your musical talent makes us appreciate the music itself, and our admiration for you only grows.
        You have been there for many firsts and many core memories since the start of this new chapter in our lives. You live a busy life and we don’t get to see you very often, but now as we spend more time together, we are only more excited for the coming three years to get closer and become a part of the memories you make at Davis.</p>
        <p>With love, Kina & Vish </p>
