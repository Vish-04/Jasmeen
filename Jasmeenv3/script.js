From the day I invited you into my dorm to today, youâ€™ve been a strong and steady person that I know I can rely on if I ever face any difficulty. I hope you feel the same about me. Iâ€™ll always be there if you ever need me. Although we do not talk a lot, your presence in my life gives me a lot of joy. Our shared music, culture, and life experiences gives me a lot of comfort in a place where I donâ€™t see many people like myself. Keep being yourself and let no one change you. ~ Love, Gursheen", "Dear Jasmeen, The first day I met u, I knew we would become really good friends and i am so glad to have someone like u in my life.

Love u loads ~ RiaðŸ˜˜", "Happy Birthday Jasmeen, the mother penguin to all our friends: From the first night of move in, when we went on a night run to the library and the 7 am run the next day, I am so glad to have seen both the composed person you are and the chaos that appears at our late night talks. Even though weâ€™ve had few conversations, Iâ€™ve come to respect your sense of self, your experiences, and your love for music. I hope to be there to help you the way you have been there for me when I needed it. If you ever want to wash dishes at 1 am or go running at the crack of dawn, you know Iâ€™m always free! Iâ€™m so excited to live with you next year <3 ~ Kina & Vish", "Happy birthday Jasmine ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’– U r gorgeous mashaallah May this be the best year of ur life!!

Your stories and our talks are always so inspiring. You are an amazing singer, never failing to amaze us with your melodious songs. We love how you spontaneously burst into songs and still make it sound effortless. In a way, your musical talent makes us appreciate the music itself, and our admiration for you only grows. You have been there for many firsts and many core memories since the start of this new chapter in our lives. You live a busy life and we donâ€™t get to see you very often, but now as we spend more time together, we are only more excited for the coming three years to get closer and become a part of the memories you make at Davis. ~ Diya", "W Jasmeen ~ Sanjay"],
