    <p id="caption">Silent but present. I think that explains our relationship very well. From the day I invited you into my dorm to today, you’ve been a strong and steady person that I know I can rely on if I ever face any difficulty. I hope you feel the same about me. I’ll always be there if you ever need me. Although we do not talk a lot, your presence in my life gives me a lot of joy. Our shared music, culture, and life experiences gives me a lot of comfort in a place where I don’t see many people like myself. Keep being yourself and let no one change you. Love, Gursheen</p>

      <p>Dear Jasmeen,</p>

      <p>Happy Birthday! We are so lucky to call you a friend. We can’t think of a better way to celebrate your birthday than by telling you how much you mean to us.
        
        Your positive energy and enthusiasm for life is contagious! Your spirit is always uplifting, and we admire how you never fail to think outside the box. Your creative approach to life is inspiring and has taught us to always look at the world in a different light.
            
        Speaking of creativity, your singing talent is simply remarkable. Every time you burst into song, you easily captivate our hearts. We love how you share your melodic voice with us and take us on a journey to another place. We can sense your passion for music when you sing and we’re lucky to experience it.
            
        You’ve been a part of many of our firsts and have been by our side through thick and thin. We truly cherish your friendship and the time we’ve been able to spend together. We know life can be hectic so we are especially thankful for the days we get to spend with you.
            
        We hope your birthday is as special as you are and that you have a wonderful day full of love and laughter!</p>

        <p>With love, Kina & Vish </p>
